Hello, I'm Martin, your gamebot.
Let's play an animal guessing game!
There are 3 animals: wolf, eagle, snake (a Python of course).
The wolf scares the eagle.
The eagle grabs the snake.
The snake bites the wolf.
I'll pick one and you pick one and we'll see who wins.

wolf, eagle, snake: eagle

You said eagle.
I said eagle.

We tied!
